# Connected-Component-Labeling-and-Set-Operations
Desiged to consider the application of a sequence of simple image-processing operationsto an image, such as connected-component labeling and logical (set) operations.

# Description
1.Bright Region Extraction\
Automatically choose a threshold so that>5 distinct "bright" components obviously appear. Save this thresholded image, "fthresh," in a form that makesthe thresholded objects visible on the screen. Find the connected components of the thresholded image "fthresh." Then label each component with different color.\
2.Logical Operations\
Compute the following images with two input image A & B:A AND B,A OR B,A XOR B, and NOT(A), min(A,B)
